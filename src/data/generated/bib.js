        "abstract": "Generative adversarial networks are a kind of artificial intelligence algorithm designed to solve the generative modeling problem. The goal of a generative model is to study a collection of training examples and learn the probability distribution that generated them. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are then able to generate more examples from the estimated probability distribution. Generative models based on deep learning are common, but GANs are among the most successful generative models (especially in terms of their ability to generate realistic high-resolution images). GANs have been successfully applied to a wide variety of tasks (mostly in research settings) but continue to present unique challenges and research opportunities because they are based on game theory while most other approaches to generative modeling are based on optimization.",

        "abstract": "Deep learning techniques have recently been experimented for map generalization. Although promising, these experiments raise new problems regarding the evaluation of the output images. Traditional map generalization evaluation cannot directly be applied to the results in a raster format. Additionally, the internal evaluation used by deep learning models is mostly based on the realism of images and the accuracy of pixels, and none of these criteria is sufficient to evaluate a generalization process. Finally, deep learning processes tend to hide the causal mechanisms and do not always guarantee a result that follows cartographic principles. In this article, we propose a method to adapt constraint-based evaluation to the images generated by deep learning models. We focus on the use case of mountain road generalization, and detail seven raster-based constraints, namely, clutter, coalescence reduction, smoothness, position preservation, road connectivity preservation, noise absence, and color realism constraints. These constraints can contribute to current studies on deep learning-based map generalization, as they can help guide the learning process, compare different models, validate these models, and identify remaining problems in the output images. They can also be used to assess the quality of training examples.",

        "abstract": "Maps can help governments in infrastructure development and emergency rescue operations around the world. Using adversarial learning to generate maps from remote sensing images is an emerging field. As we now know, the urban construction styles of different cities are diverse. The current translation methods for remote sensing image-to-map tasks only work on the specific regions with similar styles and structures to the training set and perform poorly on previously unseen areas. We argue that this greatly limits their use. In this work, we intend to seek a remote sensing image-to-map translation model that approaches the challenge of generating maps for the remote sensing images of unseen areas. Our remote sensing image-to-map translation model (RSMT) achieves universal and general applicability to generate maps over multiple regions by combining adversarial deep transfer training schemes with novel attention-based network designs. Extracting the content and style latent features from remote sensing images and a series of maps, respectively, RSMT generalizes a pattern applied to the remote sensing images of new areas. Meanwhile, we introduce feature map loss and map consistency loss to reinforce generated maps&rsquo; precision and geometry similarity. We critically analyze qualitative and quantitative results using widely adopted evaluation metrics through extensive validation and comparisons with previous remote sensing image-to-map approaches. The results of experiment indicate that RSMT can translate remote sensing images to maps better than several state-of-the-art methods.",
